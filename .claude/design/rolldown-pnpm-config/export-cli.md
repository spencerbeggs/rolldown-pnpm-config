## Overview

`rolldown-pnpm-config export` materializes the plugin config into the consuming repo's `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. `rolldown-pnpm-config preview` is an interactive `ink-tab` explorer that shows how the file would change across three views — Changes and Full (diffs) plus Simulated (the calculated fresh-consumer file rendered as an annotated plain listing, not a diff) — without writing anything.

Both commands share a diff/render layer (`cli/ui/`, `cli/diff/`) that also feeds the colorized `upgrade` summary. The render layer's contract is the `StyledLine` type: a list of styled lines that can be turned into ANSI-colored terminal output or mapped to Ink `Text` components by a single pure function. Capability detection (color, interactivity, hyperlinks) is centralized in `cli/ui/env.ts` and threaded in as flags; render functions never read the environment.

Reference this document when changing the export pipeline, the local-merge engine, the diff/render layer or the `preview` command.

## Current state

Shipped on `feat/ui-updates`. All implementation described below is in the current state of the branch.

Key design decisions made during this phase:

- `export --preview` was removed; `export --dry-run [--full]` replaces it.
- A new standalone `preview` command provides the interactive tabbed view.
- `local.<field>` can now be a directive object `{ preserve?, value?, strategy? }` rather than a bare value; the old pre-freeze `local-overlay.ts` shallow-replace was removed.
- `file:`, `link:`, `workspace:` and `portal:` overrides are preserved by default on every `export` run, fixing a data-loss bug where managed-field writes silently dropped local protocol-prefixed override entries.
- Array fields in the canonical format are sorted lexicographically so the written file matches what the diff shows.

Since migrated to Effect v4 on `feat/effected`: the `export`/`preview` command layer moved from `@effect/cli` to `effect/unstable/cli` (`Args`→`Argument`, `Options`→`Flag`), and `workspace-file.ts`'s YAML read/write moved from `yaml` to `@effected/yaml` (a drop-in over the parse/stringify surface used here, `Yaml`/`YamlStringifyOptions`). Neither the pipeline, the local-merge semantics, the render layer nor the canonical format changed. See [architecture.md](architecture.md) for the migration's dependency-level rationale.

Extended on `feat/peer-with-colon` (recorded in [the peer-colon / preview-colors spec](specs/2026-07-20-peer-colon-and-preview-colors-design.md)): a color legend now heads every colored diff; the `unmanaged` style is actually reached by `render.ts` and painted a fixed gray distinct from dim `unchanged`; the redundant `(unmanaged)` tag is dropped when color is on; and the Simulated view was redesigned from a diff into a plain calculated-file listing with per-field merge/overwrite and enforcement annotations under its own legend. `preview`'s Enter key also exits.

## Command surface

Three subcommands registered in `package/src/cli/bin.ts`:

`rolldown-pnpm-config export [path]` — runs the effective pipeline (freeze → filter workspace fields → excludeByRepo → local directives → overlay → write). Prints `Exported to <path>` on success.

`rolldown-pnpm-config export [path] --dry-run [--full]` — same pipeline but skips the write; prints a colored canonical diff to stdout and exits. `--full` emits the entire canonical tree rather than changed lines plus context. Writes nothing.

`rolldown-pnpm-config preview [path]` — interactive `ink-tab` explorer (Changes / Full / Simulated). When the terminal is non-interactive (`!detectCapabilities().interactive`), falls back to printing the Changes view via `toAnsi` and exits — never hangs in CI or piped output.

All three reuse `buildDiff` / `renderExportDiff` / `toAnsi`. The file-arg is optional; when omitted, `findWorkspaceFile` locates the nearest `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

## Shared render layer

Lives in `package/src/cli/ui/` and is imported by the export, preview and upgrade commands.

`cli/ui/styled.ts` defines the `StyledLine` contract: an `indent` depth, a single-character `gutter` symbol (`+` added, `~` changed, `-` removed, ` ` unchanged, `·` local, `░` unmanaged, `⚠` conflict/warn), a list of `Segment`s each with a `ChangeStyle` and a text run, and an optional `DiffTag`. Gutters and tags are always present so output is meaningful with color off. The `ChangeStyle` palette gained `merge`/`overwrite` (cyan/magenta, for the Simulated annotations) and now paints `unmanaged` a fixed 256-color gray distinct from dim `unchanged`. `tagSuffix` takes the `color` flag: the `(unmanaged)` tag is dropped when color is on (the gray shade plus the legend convey it) and kept when color is off, preserving the tags-stay-meaningful-without-color contract; `(local)` is kept in both.

`cli/ui/legend.ts` exports `legendLines()` (the diff legend: added/removed/modified/unchanged/unmanaged swatches) and `simulatedLegendLines()` (merge/overwrite/warn/error). Each swatch carries the matching `ChangeStyle` so the legend tracks the palette automatically. A legend is prepended only when color is on — `export --dry-run`, `upgrade --preview/--full` and the interactive `preview` (which swaps to the simulated legend on the Simulated tab).

`cli/ui/ansi.ts` exports `toAnsi(lines, { color }): string` — a pure function that maps `StyledLine[]` to a colored (or plain) terminal string. Never reads the environment.

`cli/ui/env.ts` is the only module that imports `std-env` and `std-osc8`. It exports `detectCapabilities(): { color, interactive, hyperlinks }` and re-exports `link` from `std-osc8` for optional OSC-8 hyperlinks. `interactive` is `hasTTY && !isCI && !isAgent`; `color` is `isColorSupported` from `std-env`.

The diff model in `cli/diff/` is a structured tree over canonicalized before/after data. See `cli/diff/types.ts` for `DiffNode` and `DiffMeta`, `cli/diff/build.ts` for `buildDiff(before, after, meta)` and `cli/diff/render.ts` for `renderExportDiff(root, { full })`. `buildDiff` compares canonicalized plain objects; `renderExportDiff` flattens the tree to `StyledLine[]` with context collapsing (default: 2 unchanged lines around each change; `--full` emits everything). `flatten` threads an `unmanaged` flag so an unchanged line carrying the `unmanaged` tag (and its descendants) renders in the `unmanaged` style rather than plain `unchanged`, making the whole passthrough block read as one shade; non-unchanged kinds keep their own style.

`workspace-file.ts#canonicalize` sorts object keys alphabetically and sorts arrays whose elements are all primitives lexicographically. This affects the written file's array order and ensures the preview diff matches the file that would be written.

## Export pipeline

`runExport` in `package/src/cli/commands/export.ts` runs the following stages in order:

1. `evaluatePluginConfig` — static AST evaluation of the config source.
2. `freeze(config)` — validates `name` and all fields; yields `{ base, manifest, name }`.
3. Filter `base` to `WORKSPACE_FIELDS` → `managed`.
4. `effectiveManaged(managed, local, parsed, manifest, rootName)` — applies `excludeByRepo` to `publicHoistPattern` (using the map from `manifest`), then per-field local directives (always including the `overrides` default-preserve step). See `cli/effective.ts`.
5. `overlayWorkspace(effective, parsed)` → `merged`.
6. `renderWorkspace(merged)` → `rendered` YAML string.
7. `buildDiff(canonicalize(parsed), canonicalize(merged), meta)` → diff tree (always computed; used only in dry-run/preview paths).
8. Write (write path) or return diff (dry-run/preview path).

## Local merge semantics

`package/src/define-plugin.ts` exports `LocalDirective<T>`: `{ preserve?, value?, strategy? }`. The `local` field of `PluginConfig` accepts either a raw value or a `LocalDirective` for each key.

`package/src/cli/local-merge.ts` provides `isLocalDirective(v)` (detects the directive form by checking that all keys are a subset of the known directive keys, so a real override record with foreign keys is treated as a bare value) and `applyLocalDirective(managed, raw, parsed, field)`.

Semantics per call:

- Bare value → overwrite managed.
- `{ value }` → overwrite managed.
- `{ strategy: "union", value }` → record merge `{ ...managed, ...value }` (value wins on key clash) or array set-union.
- `{ strategy: "difference", value }` → remove keys in `value` from managed record, or remove elements from managed array.
- `{ strategy: "merge", value }` → union semantics (an alias used by `local.patchedDependencies` to upsert owned keys while preserving unowned ones).
- `{ strategy: "rewrite" }` → passthrough; the directive carries no value and the actual rewrite happens in the patch pipeline (see [Patch distribution](#patch-distribution)).
- `preserve` (overrides only, after the above) → copy back any entry from `parsed.overrides` whose value string starts with `<proto>:` for proto in the preserve list. Defaults to `["file", "link", "workspace", "portal"]` when absent.

The `strategy` union is `"union" | "difference" | "merge" | "rewrite"`, defined on `LocalDirective<T>` in `package/src/define-plugin.ts`.

`effectiveManaged` in `package/src/cli/effective.ts` composes `excludeByRepo` (applied first) and per-field local directives for all keys in `config.local` plus `overrides` (always, for the default-preserve step).

`vanillaManaged` in `effective.ts` applies only `excludeByRepo` and no local directives; this is the "fresh consumer" base used by the Simulated preview view.

`local` is export-time only — `freeze`, `base` and the bundled runtime pnpmfile are unaffected.

## Patch distribution

A plugin author can distribute pnpm dependency patches through their config-dependency plugin. The discovery and path-rewrite logic lives in the build/CLI-side module `package/src/patches/` (`keys.ts`, `paths.ts`, `discover.ts`, `build.ts`, `reconcile.ts`), shared by the build plugin and `export` so both emit agreeing paths. It is never imported by `runtime/**` — the Effect-at-build-time boundary holds. The full intended behavior is in [the patch distribution spec](specs/2026-06-30-patch-distribution-design.md); this section records the export-side shipped surface.

Convention: `discoverPatches` walks two folders adjacent to the build file. `public/patches/` is **distributed** — the bundler ships `public/` into the package, so each file resolves in a consumer at `node_modules/.pnpm-config/<name>/<rel>` and is rewritten into `base.patchedDependencies` at build time. `patches/` (pnpm's default `patchesDir`) is **local-only** — never rewritten, never entered into `base`. Ownership is per-plugin, scoped by `name`: a plugin claims only patches under its own adjacent folders, so multiple config-deps and the repo's own `patches/` coexist; collisions are the user's to inspect via `preview` (no engine warning), and `mapChildWins` reconciles local-vs-distributed at install.

Authoring directives (no new top-level field):

- `patchedDependencies: { strategy: "rewrite" }` — discover `public/patches/` and rewrite each to its distributed path. Default behavior when patch files exist; the bare-map form remains the full-manual escape hatch.
- `local.patchedDependencies: { strategy: "merge" }` — on `export`, upsert this plugin's owned keys with their local on-disk paths, preserving every key it does not own.
- `local.localPatchesDir?: string` — override the distributed source root (default `public/patches/`). KNOWN LIMITATION: when this points outside `public/`, `distributedRel`'s basename fallback produces a `node_modules/.pnpm-config/<name>/<basename>/...` path that the bundler (which ships only `public/`) will not actually contain, so a non-public `localPatchesDir` can dangle. The intended case is a `public/` subfolder.

Export behavior: `runExport` pre-resolves the config before `freeze`, then OVERRIDES `effective.patchedDependencies` with the local on-disk paths merged by key over the existing `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. Siblings (other plugins' and repo-own entries) are preserved and the distributed `.pnpm-config` path never leaks into the local file. `runExport` also returns a `reconcile` report (`reconcilePatches`, a `PatchReconcileReport`); the `export` command prints stale-entry and key-mismatch warnings to stderr. `getFrozen` in `package/src/plugin/index.ts` freezes `withResolvedBuildPatches(config, process.cwd())`, so the emitted pnpmfile's `base.patchedDependencies` carries distributed paths — discovery roots at `process.cwd()`, which equals the build-config package dir under normal tsdown/rolldown/turbo invocation (matching the export CLI's `dirname(configFile)` root).

The descriptor table is unchanged: `patchedDependencies`/`patchesDir`/`configDependencies` descriptors stay as-is and `patchesDir` is never read by the new code. See [settings-coverage.md](settings-coverage.md).

## Preview views

`package/src/cli/preview-views.ts` exports `buildPreviewViews(input)` which returns `{ changes, full, simulated }` as `StyledLine[]` triples.

- **Changes** / **Full**: `buildDiff(canonicalize(parsed), canonicalize(merged), meta)` rendered with `{ full: false }` and `{ full: true }` respectively. `meta.localKeys` are the keys in `config.local`; `meta.managedKeys` is `WORKSPACE_FIELDS`.
- **Simulated**: no longer a diff. `renderSimulated(vanilla, manifest)` (`cli/simulated-view.ts`) renders `vanilla` — `vanillaManaged(managed, manifest, rootName)`, the fresh-consumer output with no local overlay or preserve — as a plain pnpm-workspace.yaml listing (no `+/-/~` gutters), each top-level field annotated with how the plugin combines it (`merge`/`overwrite`, from the field's manifest strategy via `STRATEGY_VERB`) and how it is enforced (`warn`/`error`). The earlier `buildDiff(parsed → vanilla)` form rendered every local-only key as a confusing red "removed" line even though nothing is actually removed.

`package/src/cli/ui/Preview.ts` is the Ink component: a `Tabs` bar via `ink-tab` over the three pre-built views, with a legend rendered below the tab bar that swaps to `simulatedLegendLines()` on the Simulated tab; tab switch is local state; `q`/Esc/Enter exits. It maps `StyledLine[]` to Ink `Box`/`Text` elements directly (no `toAnsi`) via a `ChangeStyle`→Text-props map (so `dimColor` for `unchanged` is expressible), making this the phase-2 consumer of the shared contract; being always-colored it renders only the `(local)` tag.

`package/src/cli/ui/run-preview.ts` provides `runPreview(views): Effect<void>` — the `render` + `waitUntilExit` bridge, mirroring `run-walk.ts`; both now resume the fiber with `Effect.die` if `waitUntilExit()` rejects, so an Ink crash fails the run instead of hanging it suspended forever (issue #37).

`package/src/cli/commands/preview.ts` exports `runPreviewViews(opts)` (the testable pure core) and `previewCommand` (the `effect/unstable/cli` command).

## Rationale

### Shared render layer, not per-command ad hoc color

A single `StyledLine` → `toAnsi` → ANSI string path means both `export --dry-run` and `upgrade --preview` speak the same visual language (same gutter symbols, same palette) without duplicating ANSI code logic. Capability detection is centralized in one module; render functions stay pure and unit-testable without env mocking.

### `--dry-run` replaces `--preview` on `export`

`export --preview` conflated two concerns (write vs. show). Separating them into `export --dry-run` (static, pipe-safe) and `preview` (interactive, with fallback) makes each command do one thing.

### Default override preservation

Managed-field writes previously replaced `overrides` wholesale, silently dropping local `file:` links. The default-preserve step runs on every `export` (not just when `local.overrides` is set), making the safe behavior opt-out rather than opt-in.

### `local` is post-freeze, export-time only

The runtime pnpmfile must be the same for every consumer of the plugin. Per-repo local adjustments belong only in the export step, not in the shared bundled artifact.
